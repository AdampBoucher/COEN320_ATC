# COEN 320 ‚Äî Air Traffic Control System

An embedded Air Traffic Control (ATC) simulation project built on the **QNX Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)** using **C++** and POSIX threads.

## üöÄ Overview

This project simulates a 3D controlled airspace where multiple aircraft operate as independent threads. The ATC system monitors aircraft positions, detects potential safety violations, and allows operator intervention via real-time commands.

The system meets real-time constraints for:
- Aircraft position updates
- Safety separation enforcement
- Operator command logging
- Historical data logging

---

## üß± Architecture

- **Aircraft Threads:** Each aircraft is implemented as a periodic POSIX thread using QNX timers. They update their position every second based on velocity.
- **Airspace Module:** Central registry that holds references to all aircraft for monitoring, logging, and display.
- **Logger Module:** Responsible for periodic logging of airspace state and operator commands.
- **Operator Command Parser:** Parses textual commands entered by the operator and structures them for use by the system.
- **Main Controller:** The `COEN320_ATC` program handles aircraft initialization, logging scheduling, and operator command interaction.
